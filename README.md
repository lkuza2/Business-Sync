## Welcome to BusinessSync

BusinessSync was created to solve this problem and more. Gone are the days of using the traditional print business card, instead replaced by a simple NFC solution. Employees no longer need to print hundreds of business cards for hiring events and do not need to reprint their cards if they change positions or company. The solution also allows for their contact data to update in real time if it changes, making outdated business cards an inconvenience of the past.

By using NFC tags or an NFC business card, which is registered to a user through the Android app or by using a hardware module designed for iOS, students and even other businessmen, can simply tap to add that person's business card to their BusinessSync's contact list. This contact list contains a profile image of the user who is giving their virtual business card to the receiver. In addition to a profile image, also included is the sender's contact information, company name, and other contact information. This combination of business card style contact information and profile picture allows for the receiver of the virtual card to never forget who they were talking to.

In addition to supporting NFC, the system also supports methods for iPhones to easily receive virtual business cards at career events. By using a Bluetooth system protocol by Apple, named iBeacon, a sender of a virtual business card can set up a small device around their booth at a career fair. When a potential receiver comes within close proximity of the beacon, and the sender allows for the beacon to send, the receiver will automatically receive the virtual business card of the sender, without even touching their iPhone.

The solution allows for a revolution in the business card. Not only will the convenience of giving and receiving a "business card" improve, but the environmental impact will be substantial, as business cards will no longer need to be printed or reprinted if they change.
